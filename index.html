<p>I created this at the reqest of Michael Corsetto to look into the impact that the district system has on team sustainability. Included is a list of teams in each year ([1992–2016]) in the file <code>teams.csv</code> It was created based off the Mark McLeod's data set. </p>

<p>This is a plot of the retention percentages for each year ([2005–2016]). Higher is better. </p>

<h2>
<a id="running" class="anchor" href="#running" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running</h2>

<p>There's an included R script included (<code>attrition.r</code>) that will generate a plot of team attritions in various regions. </p>

<h3>
<a id="limitations" class="anchor" href="#limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Limitations</h3>

<ul>
<li>Easily scoping down for MAR teams is very difficult. As such, instead of being 100% correct in MAR I set it up to include all Pennsylvania teams</li>
<li>Team Merges - 47/65 merging into 51 is included as attrition. It's a small enough percentage of instances that rather than trying (and failing) to remove all instances of this, I just left it in.</li>
<li>Temporary Drops - Events like the Canadian Teacher Strike caused teams to drop out a year, honestly, it's too much work to track and special case all of that. Again, likely, within noise.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="annotations" class="anchor" href="#annotations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Annotations</h3>

<p>I've created an annotations file that tries to allow for annotating the retention plot with relvant events. I haven't figured out how to automate placement on the Y Axis, for now just alternate 100 and 99. The script will pick up the annotations and add it to the annoted retention plot (shown below) Please note, the ONLY change in this plot is the annotations, any changes you make in the unannoted one will reflect in the annotated one. </p>
